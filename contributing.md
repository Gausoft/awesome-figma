# Contribution Guidelines

> Please, ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines. 


## Common sense

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make sure your section or item is useful before submitting. That implies it having enough content and every item a good succinct description.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.

## Format rules
- Check your **spelling and grammar**. Yeah, it includes *capitalized titles*. No, it doesn't include This Kind Of Capitalization.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- When adding a item, section or subsection, **do not forget to add an anchor link** in the table of contents, matching the current list format.

## Adding items
Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category, and in the following format:
`- [Item name](link)`.

> Note the `-` symbol. Your item must be included in a list, and a list is a section.

## Adding sections and subsections
If your item doesn't fit any section or subsection already available, create one use the following format:

```
## Section Title

###### Subsection Title
- [Item name](link)
```
